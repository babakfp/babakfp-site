*I'm angry, disappointed, and hopeful.* Why do I hate Svelte? Why do I like Svelte, What are the positives and negatives of using Svelte? Should you learn Svelte? Is learning Svelte worth it? I'm going to answer them all.

## Why I'm angry and disappointed?

- I got blocked for a lifetime from the Svlete Discord group.
- I got blocked for a lifetime from Svelte Github repositories.
- I got blocked for a lifetime from <a href="https://devto" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">devto</a> because of the article that I wrote about Svelte.
- Svelte isn't a community project. It's just an open-source project.
- Maintainers don't know anything about how to manage a community, manage a group, or simply anything!
- Toxic people live in the community and the maintainers don't do anything about it.
- MR. Rich Harris doesn't involve with the community.
- It's not good to use third-party libraries in your Svelte project!

### I got blocked for a lifetime from **Svlete Discord group**

Svelte documentation UI sucks, right? In 2021 I designed a UI and a logo for SvelteKit. I sent them to the Discord group and we talked about the design and related stuff with some people in the group. In the middle of the conversation, *suddenly I got blocked and removed completely from the group!*. I didn't find any of my messages in the Discord group. They probably cleaned up everything after removing meüòÑ. <a href="https://bit.ly/3tf6mPL" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">*You can download all UI and logo design source files I ever create for Svelte.*</a>

*This is the consequence of trying to contribute to Svelte:*

### I got blocked for a lifetime from **Svelte Github repositories**

It was so hard for me to use this dropdown, so I decided to fix it and send a PR. I did it but I couldn't predict what was going to happen after.

This is how it went:

And here is the comment that got me banned (this was removed after I got banned):

<PlatformQuote platform="github">
	<TheGithubComment />
</PlatformQuote>

*This is the result of contributing to svelte:*

![A screenshot of my Github account that shows I can't write comment in any SvelteJS repos, or I can't do even anything because I'm benned](/content/blog/i-like-svelte-but-i-hate-it/1.png)

### I got blocked for a lifetime from **<a href="https://devto" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">devto</a> because of the article that I wrote about Svelte**

After I got blocked from the Svelte repos on github, the same day, I write an article about what happened and I got blocked because of it! This is the article:

<PlatformQuote platform="devto">
	<TheDevtoArticle />
</PlatformQuote>

#### I replay to one of the comments on the article

I'm not sure but I think this is the reply that I write to the comment under the article.

<PlatformQuote platform="devto">
	<TheDevtoArticleReply />
</PlatformQuote>

### I talked with one of the maintainers of Svelte

This is the whole conversation:

<video controls>
  <source src="/content/blog/i-like-svelte-but-i-hate-it/3.mp4" type="video/mp4">
	<track kind="captions" label="A full conversation of me talking with one of the maintainers of Svelte on Discord (Kev#3238)">
</video>

This is what you can expect from a Svelte maintainerüëá. After the above conversation, he unfriended me so I couldn't message him.

![A screenshot of me sending a friend request (on Discord) to a Svelte maintainer (Kev#3238) and the friend request gets failed because he blocked me or something](/content/blog/i-like-svelte-but-i-hate-it/7.png)

### I talked with another maintainer of Svelte

Everything went wellü§©, just kidding. My heart got broken. To be honest, I wasn't expecting much. I was expecting the same. Whatever, this is the whole conversation:

<video controls>
  <source src="/content/blog/i-like-svelte-but-i-hate-it/8.mp4" type="video/mp4">
	<track kind="captions" label="A full conversation of me talking with another maintainer of Svelte on Discord (pngwn#8431)">
</video>

Oh right, my fake Discord account <img class="inline-block w-20" src="/content/blog/i-like-svelte-but-i-hate-it/9.png" alt="A screenshot of my face Discord account avatar(a kitty with a pink background) and username(Windy#4111)" /> got blocked after this. I guess [don't make silly mistakes like thisüòÇ](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/7290):

![A screenshot of my silly mistake that got my fake Discord account banned from the Svelte Discord group. It shows I created a PR with the fake account and committed with the original account](/content/blog/i-like-svelte-but-i-hate-it/10.png)

### Maintainers don't know anything about how to manage a community

Svelte maintainers don't know what the heck they are doing. Did anyone see the Svelte Summit live üêïüí© video quality? They don't even try to do a good job. Svelte maintainers never managed a community before so they are doing dumb üí© all the time. You can easily find toxic people in Svelte's Github and Discord community and the maintainers don't do anything about it, but for sure they will ban you for life for no reason.

If you are a back-end developer and this is everything you know, you don't get to make decisions for example about the UI design. If you don't know how to manage a group or a community, don't even try it. *Don't do üí© that you don't know anything about.*

### Rich Harris doesn't involve with the community

You can't find Rich Harris in the Svelte's Discord community. Since 2020 when I started using Svelte, I never see him in the community. There is no account with the name Rich Harris in the group. He is the creator of the Svelte and it's impossible to see him interact with the community. Other people try to help each other in this group (other than the Svelte's toxic members) but Rich Harris never came to say Hi! Weird right? *Do not lie, I had a little bit of interaction with him on Github. I also see him replying to/answering some Twitter comments.*

### Last Talks

I like the tool but not everything that comes with it that it's *absolutely disgusting*.

### They are just showing you what you want to see!

They are telling you that Svelte supports A11Y, it even punishes the developers for not following the A11Y best practices! But the true story is that the Svelte documentation itself doesn't even follow the basics of A11Y! Besides that, Svelte docs don't even have a dark mode! This is a similar story to saying that we are gonna fundraise some money and give it to poor people but in reality, they don't give an f^ck about poor people! They also don't give an f^ck about developers. They are some most-requested feature requests in Svelte Github but they just don't give an f^ck about what you need and about your opinions.

You can verify this by talking with other Svelte devs and seeing it with your own eyes in Svelte Github.

### Stop punishing me for not following the A11Y best practices - A11Y üí©

Svelte punishes you for not following A11Y best practices and the Svelte team doesn't give an f^ck about it. They don't even provide you with an option to disable the warnings! So you end up with something like this:

![A screenshot of Svelte A11Y warnings in vsCode console after running the web app](/content/blog/i-like-svelte-but-i-hate-it/6.png)

Svelte doesn't even fully support A11Y and it's not smart enough to warn you whenever you don't comply. **Such a Büí©**

## Other negative things about Svelte

I already explained some of the negative points of Svelte but it's literally endlessüòê So let's talk more.

- Slow development (because of:)
  * Bad (code, work, ) management
  * Unreadable bad source code
  * No documentation or roadmap or anything
- No role management for maintainers
- Toxic people in the community
- Not a lot of content available
- Not a great documentation
- Uncertain *future* with unknown *features* in the future.
- etc

## About me

I'm a front-end developer. I have around 5 years of experience in development in general. I also have good knowledge and experience in UI design and Wordpress theme and plugin development. I'm a community manager since 4 or 5 years ago. I started to use Svelte in 2020.

### How was I introduced to Svelte?

In a dev-related group, someone was talking about how Svelte is easy to use and etc. I jumped into the conversation and asked what about the performance? He sent me a screenshot of a comparison between Svelte and other front-end frameworks and Svelte was above all.
