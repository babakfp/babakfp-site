## Docs

Documentation content and the design needs a rewrite and a redesign. There is a lot of content missing in the docs It's the year 2022 and we don't have a freaking Dark Mode! A proper way of accessing and searching content. Algolia sucks because it's not accessible it some countries like Iran, so need to use a VPN to be able to use it!
